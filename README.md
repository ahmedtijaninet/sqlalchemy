# sqlalchemy
This Script provides examples of how to use SQLAlchemy to connect to different types of databases and perform CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations on them. SQLAlchemy is a popular object-relational mapper (ORM) for Python that makes it easy to work with databases.

For each database, the code first creates a connection to the database using the create_engine function from SQLAlchemy. It then creates a session using the sessionmaker class and defines a Base model for the tables in the database.

Next, the code defines a model for a table in the database using the declarative_base class from SQLAlchemy. This model specifies the name of the table and the columns it contains, as well as the data types of each column.

Once the model is defined, the code creates the table in the database using the create_all method of the Base.metadata object. It then performs some CRUD operations on the table, such as inserting new records, querying the table for all records, updating a record, and deleting a record.

The code provided is just an example and may not be complete or fully functional. It is intended to illustrate how SQLAlchemy can be used to connect to different types of databases and perform CRUD operations on them. For more detailed information and examples, please see the SQLAlchemy documentation.
